## 📚 Project Overview

### ✅ Project 1 — How AI Reads and Understands Mortgage Documents
Learn the fundamentals of AI document processing:
- Machine Learning, Deep Learning, NLP, LLMs, and Computer Vision
- OCR and extraction of text from scanned documents
- Understanding structured vs. unstructured data
- Real-world mortgage "blob" document analysis

➡️ Outcome: Understanding how AI interprets documents and why automation matters in the mortgage industry.

---

### ✅ Project 2 — Working With Python for AI Document Processing
- Introduction to Python and Google Colab
- Data preparation, cleaning, and standardization
- Image preprocessing to improve OCR accuracy

➡️ Outcome: Producing clean input data for AI automation.

---

### ✅ Mortgage Industry Deep Dive
Estimated time: ~40 minutes  
Understanding:
- Key pain points in mortgage processing
- Why documentation accuracy matters
- How AI can reduce inefficiencies and human error

➡️ Outcome: Business context to connect AI solutions to real-world needs.

---

### ✅ Project 4 — Advanced OCR Comparison & Layout-Aware Extraction
Compare 3 OCR engines:
- **Tesseract**
- **PaddleOCR**
- **EasyOCR**

Tasks include:
- Text extraction from PDFs
- Layout-aware document handling
- Performance evaluation and recommendation

➡️ Outcome: Ability to select the right OCR tool based on technical and business requirements.

---

### ✅ Project 5 — Introduction to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Build a RAG pipeline using **LlamaIndex**
- Use AI models to search inside large document sets

➡️ Outcome: AI can now retrieve relevant content instead of scanning manually.

---

### ✅ Project 6 — Advanced RAG with Open-Source Models
Enhancements include:
- Chunking strategies
- Metadata filtering
- Testing open-source LLMs: **Mistral**, **Phi-2**, etc.

➡️ Outcome: High-performance document retrieval and model comparison skills.

---

### ✅ Project 7 — Blob Processing, Classification, and Routing
- Split multi-document "blob" PDFs into individual files
- Classify document types (e.g., pay slip, ID, contract)
- Route each document to the correct extraction logic

➡️ Outcome: Automated system that mirrors real-world mortgage workflows.

---

### ✅ Project 8 — RAG Chatbot using Gradio
- Build a **chatbot UI** that interacts with the RAG pipeline
- Ability to swap LLMs (Gemini, Phi, Mistral, etc.)

➡️ Outcome: User-friendly interface for querying document content.

---

### ✅ Project 9 — Final End-to-End Integration
- Combine OCR → extraction → RAG → chatbot UI
- Test performance, accuracy, and speed
- Create final demo with documentation and walkthrough

➡️ Outcome: A complete AI-powered Document Automation Platform.
